# LazyVim autoinstall
this is an installer for Neovim/LazyVim.
It will automatically install:
- Neovim, building it from source on your machine.
- LazyVim
and all their dependencies.

This installer is tested and valid for Debian based distributions (tested on Debian 12). I am not sure if it will work for other distros as well but I am working on it.
